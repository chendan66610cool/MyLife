# MyLife

I suddenly realized I should make a website for myself as a programmer.

Recording all my life is a pretty good experience, which will let me have a deeper recognition of myself.

I can record, express and imagine in my world. And don't let anyone know my secrets.

But actually I don't have dirty secrets. I just think no one can understand my world, so I want to write all my thoughts about everything I meet or feel.
